<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Color can be described by many models, RGB being the most common. Other color models are HSV, HEX, and HSL. HSV is straightforward and very intuitive. H stands for <strong>hue</strong> (a value between 0 and 360). S stands for <strong>saturation (</strong>a value between 0 and 100). V stands for <strong>value/brightness (</strong>a value between 0 and 100). A change in any of these values provides predictable results across the light spectrum.</p>

<p><strong>Django Framework </strong>and <strong>Django Rest Framework </strong>(DRF) can produce a view that takes a POST request with data in JSON format. JSON data should have an HSV color representation with two instructions â€” an operation to perform (saturation or desaturation) and the amount as a percentage, so if the <code class="language-json">amount</code> is 5 and <code class="language-json">saturation</code> is 85, then the color we get is <span class="math-tex">\(85 + 85 *0.05 = 89.25\)</span>. The response is a JSON object that contains the modified color. Please use the <em>modify-color </em>path_info to map <em>hostname:port/modify-color/</em>.</p>

<p>You can use either <strong>Postman </strong>or <strong>BrowsableAPIRenderer</strong>. They are provided by default by DRF for tests and experiments. The view can be accessed by navigating to <em>localhost:8000/modify-color/</em> URL using your preferred web browser.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Create a Django view that receives a request with color and returns a modified version of it in the response.</li>
	<li>The saturated color should have rounded values, for example. if saturation is 80.75, round it to 81.</li>
	<li>Use the <em>modify-color/ </em>path_info for URL mapping.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="language-json">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1: </strong>A de<em>saturation request</em></p>

<p>Request:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "representation": "hsv",
  "color": [
    128,
    85,
    95
  ],
  "operation": "desaturate",
  "amount": 5
}</code></pre>

<p>Response:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HTTP status code: 200</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "representation": "hsv",
  "color": [
    128,
    85,
    95
  ],
  "operation": "desaturate",
  "modified_color": [
    128,
    81,
    95
  ]
}</code></pre>
